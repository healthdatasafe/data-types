# Pryv data types

Standard event and tag types used in Pryv.


## Effective versions

The types effectively in use are published on [our API site](http://api.pryv.com).

### Event types

- Hierarchical structure (= `event-types.json` in this repo): http://api.pryv.com/event-types/hierarchical.json
- Flat structure (processed): http://api.pryv.com/event-types/flat.json
- Extras (= `event-extras.json` in this repo): http://api.pryv.com/event-types/extras.json


## How to contribute

Things currently stand at the proposal level, with some types reasonably stable, others more likely to change, and many others missing. At this stage, **we definitely need your feedback and contributions**. You can either [add issues](https://github.com/pryv/data-types/issues) or [fork and propose pull requests](https://github.com/pryv/data-types/fork). Please always include example use cases with your issues/pull requests.
