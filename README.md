# Pryv data types

Standard event types used in Pryv.


## Effective versions

The types effectively in use are published on [our API site](http://api.pryv.com).

## Contents

- **dist/** Proccessed files ready to be used and consumed by applications and services 

  - **events-types.json** Event types represented in a hierarchical structure. It's mainly used for documentation generation purposes.
    Extract of the structure: 

    ```json
    {
      "version": "0.x.0",
      "classes": {
      	 "angle": {
          "description": "The figure formed by two rays.",
          "formats": {
            "deg": {
              "description": "Degrees",
              "type": "number"
            },
            "grad": {
              "description": "Grade",
              "type": "number"
            }
          }
        },
        "note": {
          "description": "To record different kinds of text-based notes, from simple text to more complex formatted content like social network posts.",
          "formats": {
            "html": {
              "description": "An HTML-formatted note.",
              "type": "string",
              "maxLength": 4194304
            },
            "txt": {
              "description": "A plain-text note.",
              "type": "string",
              "maxLength": 4194304
            }
          }
        }
      },
     "extras": {
      	"angle": {
          "name": {
            "en": "Angle",
            "fr": "Angle"
          },
          "formats": {
            "deg": {
              "name": {
                "en": "Degrees",
                "fr": "Degrés"
              },
              "symbol": "°"
            },
            "grad": {
              "name": {
                "en": "Gradians",
                "fr": "Grades"
              },
              "symbol": "grad"
            }
          }
        }
     	}
    }
    ```

    

  - **flat.json** Event types in a key / value structure. Is main usage being for applications that require data format validations.

    This file is the one that is exposed by Pryv.io `service/info/` route with the `eventTypes` property. Exemple: [https://reg.pryv.me/service/info](https://reg.pryv.me/service/info)
    Note: Only the properties `version` and `types` are mandatory.

    ```json
    {
      "version": "0.3.0",
      "types": {
        "angle/deg": {
          "description": "Degrees",
          "type": "number"
        },
        "angle/grad": {
          "description": "Grade",
          "type": "number"
        }
      },
      "extras": {
        "angle/deg": {
          "name": {
            "en": "Degrees",
            "fr": "Degrés"
          },
          "symbol": "°"
        },
        "angle/grad": {
          "name": {
            "en": "Gradians",
            "fr": "Grades"
          },
          "symbol": "grad"
        }
      },
      "classes": {
         "angle": {
          "description": "The figure formed by two rays.",
          "extras": {
            "name": {
              "en": "Angle",
              "fr": "Angle"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

  - **flat.min.json** Indentical to flat.json with only the mandatory fields (version and types)

  

## How to contribute

Things currently stand at the proposal level, with some types reasonably stable, others more likely to change, and many others missing. At this stage, **we definitely need your feedback and contributions**. 

You can either [add issues](https://github.com/pryv/data-types/issues) or [fork and propose pull requests](https://github.com/pryv/data-types/fork). Please always include example use cases with your issues/pull requests.

The format validation follows  [JSON SCHEMA](https://json-schema.org) specification and Pryv.io uses [z-schema](https://github.com/zaggino/z-schema) for validation.

#### 1- Clone this repository 

run `npm install`

#### 2- Edit package.json  `version` value

This will be used as the version for the files generated in `/dist`

#### 3- Modifiy or add files in the directory `/src-classes`

Filenames are not important as long as they end with `.json` for readability we recommend separating classes in independent files with their corresponding filename.

##### Content of a `{classKey}.json` file

A json formated document as an `Object`with the following properties

- **{classKey}** they key of the class for example `"angle"` for angles measures
  - **description** (optional) `string` 
  - **extras** (optional) can contain anything that would be relevant for your Apps.
    - **name** (optional)
      - **{languageCode}** Name of this class in a specific language 
  - **fromats** `Object` each property key beign a format of this class. 
    -  **{fromatKey}** they key of the format examples: `"deg"` for degrees. 
      The content of this properties should follow [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) format.
      - **description** (optional) `string`
      - **type** `Mixed` as per JSON schema
      - **extras** (optional) they will be stripped out in a separete "extra" place at build.

Examples:

- Minimalist **angle.json** file

```json
{
  "angle": {
  "formats": {
    "deg": {
      "type": "number"
    },
    "grad": {
      "type": "number"
    }
  }
}
```

- Extended **angle.json** file

```json
{
  "angle": {
    "formats": {
      "deg": {
        "description": "Degrees",
        "type": "number",
        "extras": {
          "name": {
            "en": "Degrees",
            "fr": "Degrés"
          },
          "symbol": "°"
        }
      },
      "grad": {
        "description": "Grade",
        "type": "number",
        "extras": {
          "name": {
            "en": "Gradians",
            "fr": "Grades"
          },
          "symbol": "grad"
        }
      }
    },
    "description": "The figure formed by two rays.",
    "extras": {
      "name": {
        "en": "Angle",
        "fr": "Angle"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### 4- Build the document to `/dist`

run `npm run build`

Three new versions of files in `/dist`

- **event-types.json**
- **flat.json**
- **flat.min.json** 

#### 5- Publish these files on a web sever and expose flat.json or flat.min.json.

`flat.json` or `flat.min.json` should be exposed by **Pryv.io** from `service/info`
